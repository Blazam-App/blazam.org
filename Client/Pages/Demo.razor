<Paragraph>We've prepared a demo of the app connected to a sample Active Directory Domain. It's  fully
    functional but there are some considerations...
</Paragraph>

    <UnorderedListItem>
        There are no computers in the sample domain, this would be expensive to replicate.
    </UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>
        For security reasons, setting changes are disabled and some information will be censored.
    </UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>
        Remember that this is still beta, there will be bugs.
    </UnorderedListItem>
    <UnorderedListItem>
        Also, the web server and Active Directory/SQL servers are not on the same
        network, so it will be slower than in a proper environement. Plus it's a free web host.
